Even though data production has been in its all-time high, almost all the data is unlabelled, hence making them unsuitable for training the algorithms. This paper proposes a novel method of extracting the features using Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD). The experiment is performed using data samples from Imagenet. The learning is done using SVM-linear, SVM-RBF, Random Kitchen Sink approach (RKS). The results have shown that DMD features with RKS give competing results.","tags":["limited-data","dmd"],"title":"Dynamic Mode Decomposition based feature for Image Classification","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rahul Vigneswaran","Neethu Mohan","Soman KP"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1555960755,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1555960755,"objectID":"eae6444277c5bae38720240c5ef5d59c","permalink":"/publication/data-drive-computing-for-elasticity-via-chebyshev-approximation/","publishdate":"2020-03-29T00:49:15+05:30","relpermalink":"/publication/data-drive-computing-for-elasticity-via-chebyshev-approximation/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper proposes a data-driven approach for computing elasticity by means of a non-parametric regression approach rather than an optimization approach.

Reasons including uncertainty in ﬁnding the types of attacks and increased the complexity of advanced cyber attacks, IDS calls for the need of integration of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). In this paper, DNNs have been utilized to predict the attacks on Network Intrusion Detection System (N-IDS). A DNN with 0.1 rate of learning is applied and is run for 1000 number of epochs and KDDCup-’99’ dataset has been used for training and benchmarking the network. For comparison purposes, the training is done on the same dataset with several other classical machine learning algorithms and DNN of layers ranging from 1 to 5. The results were compared and concluded that a DNN of 3 layers has superior performance over all the other classical machine learning algorithms.","tags":["cyber-security","intrusion-detection-system"],"title":"Evaluating Shallow and Deep Neural Networks for Network Intrusion Detection Systems in Cyber Security","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"\r[May 2020] : Working remotely with Piero Molino from Uber AI, San Francisco, USA.\n[July 2019] : Joined as a Research Intern under Dr Vineeth N Balasubramanian at IIT Hyderabad\u0026lsquo;s Machine Learning and Vision Lab.\n","date":1512066600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1512066600,"objectID":"a0812ae5f3c926fea6faf4472cefc8e2","permalink":"/news/","publishdate":"2017-12-01T00:00:00+05:30","relpermalink":"/news/","section":"","summary":"\r\nList of news.\r\n","tags":[],"title":"News","type":"page"}]
